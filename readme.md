# Data analysis of Spanish Autonomous Community election data

**[View the analysis!](https://spaniel01.github.io/Py_Seaborn_Spain_AC_elec_analysis/)**

As part of this project, data was collected from various sources, cleaned and an analysis of Spain's Autonomous Community (regional) election results conducted. The analysis is primarily graphics based, using Python's Seaborn, and rendered via Jupyter Lab. 

The files in this repository include:
- The **.py file**, in which the **data cleaning** took place (at the beginning). This involved checking (and filling in) missing values, converting vars to the correct type, renaming values, checking value ranges, checking unique values, checking outliers etc.
- The **.ipynb** notebook file, which mostly contains the code with which data was manipulated and graphs generated, and which is also contained in the .py file.
